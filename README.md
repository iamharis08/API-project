## Aribnbs   

Airbnbs is a clone website of the original Airbnb and allows users to be able to see numerous
vacation home rental spots, host new spots for other users to engage with and to be able to leave
reviews. 

One can create, read, update, and edit spots and reviews. The user has the ability to view all spots and reviews
without having to log in. If the user wants to create, edit, or delete a spot or a review, then the user must log in.
If the user is not logged in and tries to create a spot or create a review, the buttons will open Login/Sign up Modals automatically
so that the user can sign in. If the user is logged in and owns the current spot, then the user can edit or delete the spot once the owned spot is clicked on
from the home page. A review cannot be written on the users own spot. A user can only write on review per spot and can delete the review and replace that review with a new one.
